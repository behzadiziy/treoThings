## üåÄ Optional Feature: Blueprint Package

TreoThings leverages the **Blueprint** package to streamline the creation of Laravel components, such as:

- Models
- Migrations
- Controllers
- Policies
- Form Requests

Blueprint allows developers to define components in a concise **YAML-based DSL (Domain-Specific Language)** and auto-generate Laravel files, reducing boilerplate code and development time.

### How to Use Blueprint in TreoThings

1. **Install Blueprint** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   composer require --dev laravel-shift/blueprint
   ```

2. **Define Components** in `draft.yaml`:
   Example `draft.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   models:
     Board:
       name: string
       description: text
       user_id: id
   ```

3. **Run Blueprint Commands**:
   Generate files:
   ```bash
   php artisan blueprint:build
   ```

4. Review and adjust the generated files to fit your specific use case.
